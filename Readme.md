# Lombiq Fields Orchard module



## About

An [Orchard CMS](http://orchardproject.net/) module that adds some useful content fields:

- Media Library Upload Field: a modified version of Media Library Picker Field that enables users to upload files attached to content items.
- Money Field: a field for storing money-related values such as amount and currency using the [.NET Money type](https://bitbucket.org/rplaire/money-type-for-the-clr).

The fields have their separate features that you can enable; after this the fields will be available to be added to content types. Note that the fields also have content type-level settings.

The module is also available for [DotNest](http://dotnest.com/) sites.
