# Lombiq Fields Orchard module readme



An [Orchard CMS](http://orchardproject.net/) module that adds some useful content fields:

- Media Library Upload Field: a modified version of Media Library Picker Field that enables users to upload files attached to content items.
- Money Field: a field for storing money-related values such as amount and currency using the [.NET Money type](https://bitbucket.org/rplaire/money-type-for-the-clr).

The fields have their separate features that you can enable; after this the fields will be available to be added to content types. Note that the fields also have content type-level settings.

The module's source is available in two public source repositories, automatically mirrored in both directions with [Git-hg Mirror](https://githgmirror.com):

- [https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/smart-notifications](https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/lombiq-fields) (Mercurial repository)
- [https://github.com/Lombiq/Smart-Notifications](https://github.com/Lombiq/Lombiq-Fields) (Git repository)
